|Roll|sneak when falling from a height, causing less fall damage|
|Dive roll|place/RMB and press up, useful to dive faster forward|

You can use all flips to reach more height and come over obstacles on 2 blocks while running,
but sideflips wont hurt on obstacles and there is no risk you breaks your neck.
